ci1: Qinyuan Spring•Changsha
ci11: In late autumn, I stood alone at the head of Orange Islet, the Xiangjiang River flowing northward.
ci12: All mountains had become red, and row upon row of trees looked dyed;
ci13: The river was clear and bright, big ships rushing forward.
ci15: Facing the vast universe I melancholy sighed, who should dominate the ups and downs of this vast land?
ci16: Recalling the extraordinary years of the past, I used to roam here with lots of my schoolmates.
ci17: We students were just in the prime of our youth;
ci18: Filled with the scholar’s enthusiasm, we were passionate and energetic.
ci19: Commenting on state affairs by writing articles of criticism or praise, we regarded those warlords and bureaucrats as dirt.
ci110: Do you still remember that the waves we made almost blocked the speeding boat when swimming in the middle of the river?
